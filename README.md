A script to combine higher resolution icons with the original morrowind icons as mipmaps, getting the best of both worlds in the process.


Uses https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54708?tab=description and https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/54708?tab=description as the bases for the bigger icons.
